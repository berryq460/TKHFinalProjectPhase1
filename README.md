 4. APIs we will use: Goal-- > 4 API endpoints: 
*From open weather*
*From google maps*
*From photo API (Pexels)
From plant API(Trefle)

Our goal is to help users (specifically garden or agricultural enthusiasts) learn about different plants in different parts of the world and they learn about the characteristics

We will have an autocomplete search bar where the user inputs a plant name, finds out about the species, location on the map, and the weather of that environment that makes this location a prime area for growth for that plant.

5. Meeting requirement as a team by:

-Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
-Using Axios to retrieve data from an external source, and render such data into the DOM.
-Using flexbox
-Implementing responsive design on 3 screen sizes, desktop, tablet and mobile using media queries.
-Hosting on either Netlify or Surge.
-Using an ENV file if our API requires the use of an API Key

6. Extras- Autocomplete bar, Google maps feature, 4 APIs
