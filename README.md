# Project Proposal- Phase 1- "Plant-o-pedia" :herb::earth_americas::mag:

1. **Name:** Plant-o-pedia
2. **Features:**  Learn about plants from from all around the world! See what the weather and location is like, where different species of plants inhabit and where on the map it’s located.

>**Function:** Our goal is to help educate eco-conscious users (specifically garden or agricultural enthusiasts) about different plants in different parts of the world. We hope to also include information about the weather conditions necessary for these species of plants to thrive while giving users a visualization of the location where these plants are found.

3. **Wireframes:** 
Figma --> _Wireframe Located Above_

 4. **APIs we will use:**   
>-  4 API endpoints: From the plant API(Trefle)- Plant Search, Kingdom, Family & Species 

5. **We are meeting project requirements as a team by:**

>- Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
>- Using Axios to retrieve data from an external source, and render such data into the DOM.
>- Using flexbox
>- Implementing responsive design on 3 screen sizes, desktop, tablet and mobile using media queries.
>- Hosting on either Netlify or Surge.
>- Using an ENV file if our API requires the use of an API Key

6. **Extras**- 
> __**Possible Other APIs such as:**__
>- Open weather -weather conditions in plant location
>- Google maps - location where plant is found
>- Photo API (Pexels)- photo of plant location (Ex: woods, forest, etc.)
>- Autocomplete plant search bar 


We will have an autocomplete search bar where the user inputs a plant name, finds out about the species, location on the map, and the weather of that environment that makes this location a prime area for growth for that plant.
